        "**Q1. WHAT ARE THE FIVE KEY CONCEPTS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The five key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation:** This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding the complex implementation details. It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics of the objects they represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, typically achieved through method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Classes and Objects:** At the core of OOP are classes (blueprints for creating objects) and objects (instances of classes). A class defines the properties and behaviors that its objects will have, while objects represent real-world entities.\n",

        "**Ans:** The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. It is particularly important in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The MRO ensures that the correct method is called in a consistent and predictable manner.\n",

        "**Ans:** The diamond problem is a common issue in multiple inheritance scenarios, particularly in object-oriented programming languages. It arises when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. This can lead to ambiguity about which version of a method or property should be used.\n",
